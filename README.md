Generating a Deterministic Finite State Automata from Regular Expression using Thompson's rule and Subset Construction Algorithm  with the help of c++.


## Thompson Construction
Thompson's Construction Thompson's Construction is a method in which we transform a regular expression into a (NFA) non-deterministic finite automaton. This can further be used to match strings against the expression. In this algorithm we created methods which will help execute what we intend to do.

## Subset Construction
The subset construction method, is a universal method for converting a non-deterministic finite automata to a deterministic one. The method not only does the conversion, but it is the foundation of proving the equivalence of these two kinds of automata, that is, that there is an equivalent DFA to every NFA.
